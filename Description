A program that implements the following operations in the C language:
1. Adding a node to the tree.
Each node has a counter that counts how many times the same key enters the tree.
If a key that already appears in the tree enters, we will increase the counter in the relevant node by one.
In such a case we will not add a node with the same key but only update the counter.
2. Printing the data in postorder, recursively.
3. Calculating and returning the height of the tree.
4. Finding the member with the minimum key in the tree and displaying it.
5. Searching for a member with a certain key in the tree.
